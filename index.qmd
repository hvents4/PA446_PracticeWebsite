Hello! I am a second year graduate student at the University of Illinois Chicago. This May 2024, I will be graduating with a Masters in Urban Planning and Policy.

I am currently seeking a full-time position in transportation planning. I am passionate about public transit, equitable mobility, data analysis, and geography.
